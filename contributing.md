  - For books, please copy the description and rating from [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) and link to the Goodreads entry.

```

- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Please add the entry in the correct section, in alphabetical order.
- The author link should point to the author's [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) page. If no such page exists, it should point to the author's [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) page. If that doesn't exist either, please leave the author name in plain text instead of a link.
- Please add your name to your commentary, so we know who made it.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.

Categories: `ai` `action` `not about batman`
```

Thank you for your suggestions!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
